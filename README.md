# restaurant-finder

My first attempt at building a MERN stack: https://tiny-tan-harp-seal-wrap.cyclic.app/ 

Users can search for a restaurant and leave a rating. 

Features include: 
- Users can search by name, cuisine, or borough in one search input 
- Count of search results rendered as a title 
- Results rendered 24 at a time - button to render more results only if there are more to be rendered 
- Results ordered by highest overall rating and number of ratings 
- Button back to search results only if the user navigated from a search 
- Ratings ordered from newest to oldest 
- Loading useState to prevent components flashing 
- Responsive layout
